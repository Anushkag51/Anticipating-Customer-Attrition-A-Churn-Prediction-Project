# Anticipating-Customer-Attrition-A-Churn-Prediction-Project
Using data and analytics to predict which customers are likely to close their bank accounts or stop using specific bank services.
# Description
# Problem Statement
The term "customer churn" refers to a customer's decision to stop using a business's services. Companies regularly analyse customer turnover because knowing which customers are likely to leave can be very beneficial to the business. Because most businesses have a huge number of clients and cannot afford to spend a lot of time with each one, individual customer retention is difficult. The greater revenue would be outweighed by the excessive costs. But if a business could predict ahead of time which customers are most likely to quit, it might concentrate its customer retention efforts on these "high risk" customers alone. 
# objective
The aim of this project is to train a machine learning model on the available data to train a machine learning model that will predict with a high accuracy which customers are about to churn, which in turn will help the business owner in making useful marketing decisions. 
The ultimate objective is to increase consumer loyalty and cover more ground. The client is the essential component for success in this sector.
Because it is far less expensive to keep current customers than to get new ones, customer turnover is an important statistic. Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.
